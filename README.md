# coding-challenge-9
This coding challenge adds in use of D3.js. We began implementing our simple html strucutre like the last few challenges, then we added in styles for div elements to show data points, height/width, color, etc. Next we created a java  script to write a function that would intialize our html page with all the div elemnts and added in interactive behaviors. Lastly, we added in a more "vibrant" backround color on "mouseover" and had it revert back to the original color on "mousein". This project was more challenging than the last few as we implemented some new skills! I learned alot on this challenge and added new skills to my knowldege set.
